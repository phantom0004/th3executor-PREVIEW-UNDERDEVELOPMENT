## Code Snippets and Updates
In this repository, you will find incomplete snippets of the code that will be used in the final version of th3executor. These snippets are provided to give you a rough idea of what will be implemented and to showcase the ongoing development process.

## What to Expect
- Rough Idea of Features: The snippets here represent various features and components that are under development.
- Periodic Updates: I will update these Python scripts periodically to reflect new features and enhancements.
- Preview of Implementation: While the snippets provide a glimpse into the functionality, they are not standalone programs.

## Important Notes
- Incomplete Functionality: These scripts are part of a larger framework and require other components to function correctly. They are not fully operational on their own.
- Preview Only: The snippets are intended for preview purposes only and should not be used for deployment or production.

## Getting the Full Picture
The complete, integrated program will be released in a new repository once development is finished. Until then, you can follow this repository for updates and insights into the development process.
